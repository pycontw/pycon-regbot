#### How to Get Tokens for `corporate.csv` and `individual.csv`?

```sql
SELECT
  REPLACE(JSON_EXTRACT(ATTENDEE_INFO, '$.qrcode'), '"', '') AS token
FROM
  `pycontw-225217.ods.ods_kktix_attendeeId_datetime`
WHERE
  (REFUNDED IS NULL
    OR REFUNDED = FALSE)
  AND NAME LIKE '%<year>%'  -- year param: 20xx of course
  AND LOWER(NAME) LIKE '%<type>%';  -- type param: <corporate, individual>
```

format:

```csv
token,
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,
```

#### How to Get Tokens for `reserved.csv`?

```sql
SELECT
  REPLACE(JSON_EXTRACT(ATTENDEE_INFO, '$.qrcode'), '"', '') AS token,
  REPLACE(JSON_EXTRACT(ATTENDEE_INFO, '$.ticket_name'), '"', '') AS ticket_name
FROM
  `pycontw-225217.ods.ods_kktix_attendeeId_datetime`
WHERE
  (REFUNDED IS NULL
    OR REFUNDED = FALSE)
  AND NAME LIKE '%<year>%'  -- year param: 20xx of course
  AND LOWER(NAME) LIKE '%reserved%';
```

format:

```csv
token,ticket_name
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx,Speaker 講者票（with Pyckage）
```

#### Where to Put These Tokens

1. `gcloud beta compute ssh --zone "asia-east1-b" "pycontw-website" --project "pycontw-225217"`
2. `cd /home/jordan/pycon-regbot`

Because ticket has different types, there are three different CSV files
to represent each ticket type:
* `corporate.csv` for corporate tickets
* `individual.csv` for individual tickets
* `reserved.csv` for reserved tickets

Each token is stored with the following format:
```
d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e,<ticket_type>
```

Redeemed tokens will be stored in `used.csv` with the following format:
```
d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
```

### Logging
The log file is stored under `.log` folder and saved as `reg.log`.
